# Stock Hawk
An Android app for monitoring stocks. Project 3 in the Android Developer Nanodegree by Google.

# Objectives of this project
- Bring this app to production level

- Add Detail Activity
- Add App Collection Widget

## Using the Source Code
1. Clone the project 

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/maheshgaya/StockHawk.git
  $ cd StockHawk/
  ```
 
2. Generate `google-services.json` from [here](https://developers.google.com/mobile/add?platform=android). Add that to the `assets` folder
3. Run the app on an emulator greater than or equal to SDK 15 (Ice Cream Sandwich)

Known issues: On Pre-Lollipop devices, the App Widget shows "Problem Loading Widget". Otherwise, the App Widget works great on SDK 21 and above. Help me fix it if you have an idea of what could be wrong.
