# Stock Hawk, project 3
  `Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree by Google`

## Project Overview
You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

### Why this Project?
Stock Hawk gives you an opportunity to diagnose problems and practice improving apps. These skills are vital to building apps users will love.

Diagnosing issues with existing apps is key to working on large apps or continuing projects in Android. Being aware of the common pitfalls in app design frees a developer to produce novel app experiences without making the same mistakes over and over.

### What Will I Learn?
In this project, you will:

- Diagnose existing issues with an app.
- Make an app accessible to sight-impaired users.
- Allow your app to be localized for distribution in other countries.
- Handle error cases in Android.
- Add a widget to your app experience.
- Leverage the functionality of a library in your app.

## User Feedback for Stock Hawk:
**Hellen says:**

"Right now I can't use this app with my screen reader. My friends love it, so I would love to download it, but the buttons don't tell my screen reader what they do."

**Your boss says:**

"We need to prepare Stock Hawk for the Egypt release. Make sure our translators know what to change and make sure the Arabic script will format nicely."

**Adebowale says:**

"Stock Hawk allows me to track the current price of stocks, but to track their prices over time, I need to use an external program. It would be wonderful if you could show more detail on a stock, including its price over time."

**Gundega says:**

"I use a lot of widgets on my Android device, and I would love to have a widget that displays my stock quotes on my home screen."

**Jamal says:**

"I found a bug in your app. Right now when I search for a stock quote that doesn't exist, the app crashes."

**Xaio-lu says:**

"When I opened this app for the first time without a network connection, it was a confusing blank screen. I would love a message that tells me why the screen is blank or whether my stock quotes are out of date."
